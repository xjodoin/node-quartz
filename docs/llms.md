# LLM Context Files

This site provides LLM-friendly context files at the repository root to help language models use the project effectively:

- [/llms.txt](/llms.txt): Curated summary for LLMs, with links to the key Markdown docs and references
- [/llms-full.txt](/llms-full.txt): Expanded context with inline copies of the most important docs and examples

If these links do not resolve on GitHub Pages, use the raw GitHub links:

- [llms.txt (raw)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xjodoin/node-quartz/master/llms.txt)
- [llms-full.txt (raw)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xjodoin/node-quartz/master/llms-full.txt)

For more about the llms.txt proposal, see the community resources listed at llmstxt.org.
